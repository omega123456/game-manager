/**
 * Pre-script: probe for a free port and write it to `.playwright-dev-port`.
 *
 * MUST run before Playwright evaluates its config, because Playwright loads the
 * config module in every worker process. If the port were chosen dynamically
 * inside the config, each worker would race and pick a different port than the
 * one the webServer is bound to.
 *
 * Called automatically by `pnpm test:e2e` and `pnpm test:screenshots` via
 * `&&` chaining in the respective package.json scripts.
